# Water Jug Core

## Objective
Build an application that solves the Water Jug Riddle for dynamic inputs (X, Y, Z). The simulation
should have a UI to display state changes for each state for each jug (Empty, Full or Partially Full).
You have an X-gallon and a Y-gallon jug that you can fill from a lake. (Assume lake has unlimited
amount of water.) By using only an X-gallon and Y-gallon jug (no third jug), measure Z gallons of
water.
